## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes using multiple machine learning models.
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, model training, evaluation, and comparison.
 ## Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help doctors and patients take preventive action.
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset and builds ML models to determine whether a patient is at risk.
 ##   Features
Clean and organized data preprocessing
Detailed EDA with visualizations
Trained multiple ML models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
